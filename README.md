## Why?
Being a student in school for the vast majority of my life, it is an understatement to say that
learning has been a significant aspect of it. Since I realized that learning will not become any
less prevalent in my life, I might as well do it as efficiently as possible, right? That's when I

proven study methods:

spaced repetition and active retrieval. I found that the programs that were already out there 
that could automatically space out repetition were quite unwieldy and not simplistic enough 
in their user experience, so I set out to create **QuizzBuzz**, a project that anyone can use
to help memorize anything in the most effective manner.
