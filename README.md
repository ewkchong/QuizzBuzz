## Why?
Being a student in school for the vast majority of my life, it is an understatement to say that

spaced repetition and active retrieval. I found that the programs that were already out there 
that could automatically space out repetition were quite unwieldy and not simplistic enough 
in their user experience, so I set out to create **QuizzBuzz**, a project that anyone can use
to help memorize anything in the most effective manner.
